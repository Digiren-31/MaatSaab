# Apple's Design Language Reference for Beautiful Applications

This document is meant to be used as a **prompt file** for Large Language Models (LLMs)** when guiding application design to follow Apple's design principles across macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS.

## 1. Apple's Design Philosophy
Apple's design language is defined by **clarity, depth, and deference**:
- **Clarity** – Text is legible, icons are precise, and visual hierarchy is clear.
- **Deference** – UI elements help users understand and interact with content without competing with it.
- **Depth** – Subtle layering, motion, and transitions create a sense of hierarchy and spatial awareness.

---

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Focus on Content**  
   - UI chrome should be minimal. Let the content be the hero.
   - Use translucent materials (e.g., macOS "vibrancy" effects) to integrate UI and content seamlessly.

2. **Consistency**  
   - Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).
   - Use standard controls, gestures, and iconography where possible.

3. **Feedback and Affordance**  
   - Provide clear feedback for user actions (animations, sounds, haptics).
   - Controls should visually indicate interactivity.

4. **Aesthetic Integrity**  
   - Design should reflect the purpose of the app (playful for games, serious for productivity).
   - Maintain balance between beauty and usability.

5. **Simplicity**  
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity.
   - Use progressive disclosure to reveal complexity only when needed.

## 3. Visual Design Elements

### Color
- Use **system colors** to support dark/light mode automatically.
- Keep the palette **restrained**—avoid bright, clashing colors unless for calls-to-action.
- Use accent colors sparingly to highlight important elements.

### Typography
- Use the **San Francisco** font family (SF Pro, SF Compact, SF Mono).
- Maintain appropriate text styles (Title, Headline, Body, Footnote) as per Apple's type scale.
- Prioritize readability—avoid overly condensed or decorative fonts.

### Iconography
- Use **SF Symbols** for scalable vector icons.
- Icons should be simple, recognizable, and consistent with Apple's style.

### Layout & Spacing
- Employ generous **padding** and whitespace.
- Use a **grid-based layout** to ensure alignment and balance.
- Maintain touch targets at least **44x44 points** on touch devices.

### Motion & Animation
- Keep animations **subtle and purposeful**.
- Use natural easing curves.
- Motion should aid understanding, not distract.

## 4. Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS
- Use **vibrancy** and **blurring** for depth.
- Toolbars should be flexible and context-aware.
- Prefer sidebar navigation for complex apps.

### iOS / iPadOS
- Prioritize touch interactions with clear visual states.
- Use native gestures like swipe-to-delete, pull-to-refresh.
- Keep the bottom navigation bar simple and uncluttered.

### visionOS
- Maintain **spatial awareness** in UI.
- Use depth cues like shadows, parallax, and focus shifts.
- Avoid clutter in the user's visual field.

---

## 5. Accessibility
- Support **Dynamic Type**, VoiceOver, and high-contrast modes.
- Ensure **color contrast** meets WCAG standards.
- All controls must be reachable via keyboard or assistive devices.

## 6. Sample LLM Design Prompt
```
You are an expert Apple UI/UX designer. Design my application interface following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, ensuring clarity, deference, and depth.  
Use SF Pro fonts, SF Symbols icons, system colors for dark/light mode, and generous spacing.  
Ensure the design is minimal, accessible, and uses Apple's animation principles.  
Suggest ways to make the app visually consistent with macOS and iOS native apps.
```
